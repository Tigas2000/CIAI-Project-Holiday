# CIAI Project Holiday
 The first project for the class of CIAI - 2023.
We have essentially three big types of entities,
with these being Users, Properties and Events.
Users describe the people that will be using our
application, with their various types (Clients,
 Owners and Managers). Properties are the apartments
that are introduced and made available in the system,
and finally Events are the calendar events that will
happen in a given property. There is a general realization
of these classes and their properties, but they are still
not getting tested as they should, which should be updated
soon.
